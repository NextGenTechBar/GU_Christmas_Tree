Hey Scott
recieve_nope.py is put and run on any recieving pi
master_node.py is run on master. Make sure camera is set up,
or the code won't work. We could change this, but not worth the time.


Things to do:
Parsing:
   	XTweets come in as a json object. Some parsing on this
	structure is already done. Do parsing on 'text' variable
	XCreate dictionary of acceptable colors, paired with RGB values
	Xuse tweet_to_command() function to parse and figure out message
	-Deal with punctuation around colors (like @GUChristmasTree Turn Purple!)

Control:
	XCreate control script to set colors ourselves.
	XCopy master_node.send_message(), use arg[v] inputs for message
	Xssh into pi, run script with our own arguments.
	
Camera:
	-Figure out range on photo 
	-figure out where to position camera in Hemmingson
	-Make overlay. Uncomment code in master_node.camera() to include overlay
	-Timing after picture is taken

Exrta functions:
	-add extra functions to lights.
